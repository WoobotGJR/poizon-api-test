  'In the beginning, the universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. But despite all the chaos, a small planet emerged, a place called Earth, where life would eventually flourish and intelligent beings would evolve to ponder the very nature of existence.',

  'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.',

  'In the town, there were two mutes, and they were always together. Every morning they would come out of their rooms and meet on the street, then proceed to a coffee shop where they had their breakfast. They sat there, facing each other, sometimes talking with their hands, but more often just staring into the distance, each one lost in his own thoughts.',

  'The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new. Day after day, year after year, everything remained the same. The trees grew a little taller, the grass a little greener, but otherwise, life in the town passed by in an unchanging, almost hypnotic rhythm.',

  "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the planet of Golgafrincham: it was a wildly paradoxical world, home to both the most advanced and most regressive forms of life. The people of Golgafrincham were perpetually at war with themselves, debating endlessly over the most trivial matters while overlooking the more pressing issues of their society.",

  'As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his hard, as it were, armor-plated back, and when he lifted his head a little he could see his dome-like brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely.',

  'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.',

  'Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.',

  'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.',

  "All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot by a firing squad in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his. Another guy I knew was shot for something else. In the stories I’ve heard, he went to prison, then was later executed. But, for now, there is still a kind of sanity in all this.",

  'On the faraway planet of Arrakis, known also as Dune, Paul Atreides learned the most crucial of lessons: that he could shape his own destiny. The desert, with its endless expanses of sand and the ever-present danger of sandworms, became both his challenge and his teacher. Paul discovered that the only way to survive in the harsh world of Dune was to embrace the desert, to learn its ways, and to use its power to forge a new future for himself and for all of mankind.',

  'The world had changed, and it had changed quickly. Technology had advanced to the point where the lines between the virtual and the real were nearly indistinguishable. People lived their lives as much in digital spaces as in the physical world. Social interactions, work, entertainment—all had moved online, where the rules were different, and the possibilities were endless.',

  'In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who had settled in comfortably to his quiet life when one day he was unexpectedly swept off on an adventure by a group of dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf.',

  'Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.',

  'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a great battle between the forces of good and evil. The Jedi knights, protectors of peace and justice, stood against the dark side of the Force, wielding their lightsabers in defense of the innocent. But even among the Jedi, there were those who were tempted by the dark side, those who sought power above all else, and the balance of the Force hung in the balance.',
